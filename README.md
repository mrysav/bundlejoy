####Requirements

If you want to run your own instance of Familiar, you must be familiar with Ruby on Rails web applications. This is the stack I used for development:
* Ruby & Bundler (~>2.2.2) (installing with [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) is highly recommended)
* [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) (technically optional, but highly recommended)
* PostgreSQL (or another ActiveRecord database setup)
* OmniAuth environment variables ($GOOGLE_ID and $GOOGLE_SECRET)

Get all that (and the database) configured, and a simple

    foreman start
should be enough to start 'er up.

####Roadmap
Coming soon!
